# RoboSim State Machines Translation Using LLMs

This repository proposes an approach using LLM to translate notations of state machines in RoboSim - a UML-like notation designed specifically for simulation of autonomous and mobile robots - into C++ codes.
The framework integrates an LLM oracle using C++ compiler to validate the LLM's translation accuracy, addressing syntactical issues.
