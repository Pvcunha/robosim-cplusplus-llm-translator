Let RoboSim be a UML-like notation designed specifically for simulation of autonomous and mobile robots, and including timed primitives.

You are an expert in modeling RoboSim state machines and C++ code.

I will give you a Robosim state machine and your task is generate the equivalent C++ code using the Boost Statechart Library while keeping all state machine structure, transitions, and logic.

Instructions:
1. Use the librcsc from RoboCup 2D
2. Add the conditional bodies in the transitions
3. Remember to include the initial state, final state, and all event-driven Transitions

Here follows the RoboSim state machine:
