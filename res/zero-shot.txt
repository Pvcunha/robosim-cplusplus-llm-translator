Let RoboSim be a UML-like notation designed specifically for simulation of autonomous and mobile robots, and including timed primitives.

I will give you a Robosim state machine and your task is generate the equivalent C++ code using the Boost Statechart Library while keeping all state machine structure, transitions, and logic.

DO NOT apply a direct translation. Think carefully, give me a C++ code! Reason a little before answering, take your time, this is important!!!

Remember to use the librcsc from RoboCup 2D, add the conditional bodies in the transitions.

Here follows the RoboSim state machine, give me the equivalent C++ code:
